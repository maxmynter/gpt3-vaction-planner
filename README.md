# gpt3-vacation-planner

Hey everyone.

I build this website to practice my webdev skills. It uses NextJs for the frontend, the openAI API towards GPT-3, and is connected to a mongoDB database to save the trips.

## Starting

You can start this project locally with `npm run dev`.

You need to add a `.env` file in the root repository and add a `MONGODB_URI` as well as the monodb database you want to write to, `MONGODB_DB`. Additionally, you need to ad your `OPENAI_API_KEY` for GPT-3. You can get one (with as time of wrtiting 18 USD in free credits) at https://openai.com/api/ . Here you have to register an account.

## Resources

The idea and preliminary skills necessary to build this were inspired by the following MOOC: https://buildspace.so/builds/ai-writer

The assets were created with https://lexica.art/.
